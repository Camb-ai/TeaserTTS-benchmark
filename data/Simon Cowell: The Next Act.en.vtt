00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.440
When you're putting a band together…

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.840
It's like mining for diamonds.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.840
It's like these crystals.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.160
-That is the band.
-That's the band.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440
-Look at it.
-I get it.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.120
-Because it's special.
-I believe you.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
I believe myself.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.280
As much as I love my job on TV,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.640
I miss where I started,
signing artists and working with bands.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.640
There is a massive opportunity.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.840
I am gonna find a new boy band.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.400
-I love it.
-Hi, Simon.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.040
From the minute they walk in the room,
you get a feeling about someone.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.000
But there is a huge risk here.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.080
If this goes wrong,
it will be "Simon Cowell has lost it."

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.720
I lose control

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.880
I think you're exactly
what we're looking for.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.160
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Simon.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.640
Sixteen boys are coming to Miami.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.000
-Whoo!
-This is sick.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.920
They're gonna spend a week with my team.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.880
This time, it's gonna be different.
Messy, raw.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.280
You need a hell of a lot of work.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.040
-It is gonna be chaos.
-One, two, ready…

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.320
I'll never be more ready
for anything like this ever again.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
Me and Josh have been best mates.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.840
If me and Danny both got in the band,
it'd be amazing.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.480
The competition's so high.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.480
We're all such different people,
and balancing sort of our personalities

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.080
isn't the easiest thing.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.200
I don't know why
Dumb and Dumber are speaking, bro.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.160
He said Dumb and Dumber.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.560
Don't ever call us Dumb and Dumber again.
Do you understand?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640
There's so much at stake here.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.920
The chances of this working
are less than 10%.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.160
Work, for Simon, is not just work.
It's his life.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.200
-You're very tense.
-I am tense.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.840
-This is a disaster.
-I never complain.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm just there for you, because that's
what you do when you love somebody.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.440
Can I be un-miked?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.760
Oh, Lauren.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.640
I can't take everyone forward.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.440
The last thing I wanna do is put
people together who aren't gonna jell.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.600
Simon did say that he will give this
to the person who wants it the most.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.640
-I don't want to go home.
-I haven't made my mind up.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.960
-You've gotta be kind of ruthless.
-Music is the only one thing I wanna do.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.880
I have no backup plan.
I've just gotta be in the band.
