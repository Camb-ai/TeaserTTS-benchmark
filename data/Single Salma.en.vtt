00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:04.208
In India, no matter how successful
your career becomes,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.541
there's only one real promotion.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:07.750
Get married already.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.125
The clock's ticking for Salma

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:13.041
but there's still hope for a miracle.

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.791
Have you ever checked
your son's flame?

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.416
Or has it gone cold?

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.583
-Aren't you ashamed?
-Why would I be?

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.500
Am I standing here naked?

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.125
You're middle-aged 
and still checking out girls!

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.375
Who are you calling middle-aged?

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.625
Are you some teenager yourself?

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.250
I'm about ten or twelve
years younger than you.

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.750
I believe in open relationships.

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.375
No one to answer to...

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.791
...and no explanations required.

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.041
You're extremely beautiful.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.333
So, are you planning to get married?

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.875
Try the hazelnut crappuccino here.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:47.708
-Very tasty.
-Get two frappuccinos.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:52.166
There was a time when marriage
wasn't written in my fate,

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.916
and now I'm headed for an
arranged marriage in Lucknow.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:57.000
And love in London.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.916
Are you in love?

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.125
You don't want the guy
right in front of you,

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.541
and the one outside
is flirting with thin air!

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:11.833
Salma!

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.625
So who were you staring at, your mother?

00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.291
-You pervert!
-Control yourself, old man!

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.125
Talking back?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.833
-When's the wedding?
-Today.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:18.458
Today...

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.250
Were you asleep till now?

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.041
Earlier, you couldn't find even one,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.375
and now two are after you!

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.208
Well, at least
you'll get to be an uncle.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.333
Stop!

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.083
Move aside. Let them pass.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.666
This is the wedding
of Salma and Sikander.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.875
But this is our brother's wedding!

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:44.833
But who's the bride?

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:46.208
-Salma Rizvi!
-Darn you!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.083
I don't understand what to do now.

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.208
When a fortress
stays locked for years,

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:10.500
someone will need to mount it, right?
