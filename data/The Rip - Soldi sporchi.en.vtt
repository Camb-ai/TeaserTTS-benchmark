00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.250
From the outside, it looks simple.

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:08.167
You confiscate the money,
count it, and hand it over.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.500
Knock, knock, Miami police.

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:12.333
From the inside, it's different.

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.958
An anonymous tip
led us to this address.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.917
- Oh, shit.
- There's 1.4 million in here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.917
I saw at least 14 other buckets.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.917
It's a 20 million seizure.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:27.875
We need to be cautious.
Let's get the money out of here.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958
Turn off the radios.
No calls.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.875
What would you do with this?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.583
Just this.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:35.958
Everything.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.042
You've heard about the robbery squads.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.292
Cops playing
robbers.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.125
- Do you need help, Lieutenant?
- No.

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.750
No one warned us.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:48.542
The longer we stay here,
the more we risk ending up in deep shit.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:49.833
Don't trust anyone.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:53.792
I just know that what we do now
and who we talk to matters.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:55.583
Did you see?

00:00:55.667 --> 00:01:00.792
C-O-P-S.

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.333
You have 30 minutes
to get out of that house.

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.542
By any chance, did you hear
anything about him?

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.500
There are fucking moles
in every division.

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:12.542
Watch your back.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.417
- Down!
- The fence!

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.458
- I'm going over there!
- I'll take the roof.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.208
You want to steal this money, Dane?
Why don't you admit it?

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.333
Are you a snitch, Mike?

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.167
This is my scene.
Let me handle it.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.375
Are you leaving with that money?

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.583
Were you and Captain Velez
close?

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.250
What's your problem?

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.708
What the fuck is going on?

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:38.333
First of all, calm down.

00:01:38.417 --> 00:01:40.292
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.458
I don't take orders from you.

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.625
I don't trust you right now,
and that's a fucking problem!

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:51.167
Take whatever money you want
and leave.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.667
Before things end badly
for all of us.
