00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:02.166
I used to think
that when bad things happen

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.833
that it was just random chaos,

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.875
but bad things happen…

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:10.833
because you bring them on yourself.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.708
They found a body.
Let me take it as a field reporter.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.041
It could be nothing.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.541
I think we both know
it's not nothing.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.333
A woman's died, but right now 
we can't give you any more than that.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.708
That's all we got. Thank you.

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:35.416
Detective Harper!

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:36.541
Is it true you knew her?

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.333
Jeez, what was with that reporter?

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:43.500
It's my wife.

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.666
-So you got any suspects?
-Stop.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.750
Persons of interest?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.041
Hey, Anna, how you doing? 
You doing good?

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.083
-Yeah, good, Jack.
-Good. Good. It's really great to see you.

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.916
The killer usually knows
their victim.

00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.750
He stabbed 40 times.
That's pre-meditated. It's personal.

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.541
One of us might know
who the killer is.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.000
The killer could be
in this very room.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.291
I didn't hurt her, Anna.

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.416
Do you know who did it?

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.083
I didn't do it,
if that's what you're asking.

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:19.791
There are two sides

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.708
to every story.

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:26.750
Ours

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:28.916
and theirs.

00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:34.416
Yours…

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.083
You really think
I could do something like that?

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:38.083
You really think it?

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:39.916
…and mine.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:41.750
His

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.583
and hers.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.041
Which means
someone is always lying.
