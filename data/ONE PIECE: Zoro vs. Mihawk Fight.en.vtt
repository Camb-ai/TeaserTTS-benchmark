00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.260
What the hell is that?
I'm here for a sword fight.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.470
I don't hunt rabbits with a cannon.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.560
I'm no rabbit.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.354
That remains to be seen.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.216
Got you on the run, huh?

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.636
Hardly.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.434
You're strong.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.228
But fighting isn't all about strength.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.772
Stop talking and fight.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.650
You're like a little frog
croaking in a well.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.778
Croak. Croak. Croak.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:48.942
Why don't you retreat?

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.152
I can't…

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.949
or my dream will be lost forever.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.661
You're brave. I'll give you that.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.505
So I'll do you the honor
of killing you with Yoru.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.433
That's more like it.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.001
Come on.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.745
You're defeated.
Why do you persist?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:31.461
Wounds on the back are a
swordsman's greatest shame.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.429
Magnificent.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.203
Zoro!
