00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.458
 Nandu, report to the headquarters.  
 Ask them to send a team here.  

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:03.958
 Immediately!  

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.625
 There's been a massacre here, Sir.  

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:09.750
Time? It must have been 10pm.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.250
I was in my bathroom

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.291
and I heard something.

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:14.083
Then?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.750
 The entire Bansal family has been   
 wiped out in one night.   

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.083
No. Listen, 
I saw it on TV this morning

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:30.375
and started feeling anxious. 

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.666
This case is not as simple as it looks.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.208
What do you think, Jatil?

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.666
We were shown the scene of 
this entire murder a day prior.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.291
Rajesh Chand Bansal.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.625
Is a quite a ruthless man. 

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:44.833
Guards didn't come to 
know about it?

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:45.541
 And Meera

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:47.458
very conveniently 
discovers everything.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:48.708
 Meera Bansal. 

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.666
Could there be any connection 
to this incident? 

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:53.208
It was Aarav. He killed them.

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:55.791
Geeta Vora.

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.375
She is behind all this. 

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.083
What happened in 
the Bansal family 

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:01.875
that the karma wreaked 
havoc on them? 

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.458
The truth is what 
is in front of you.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.125
I will find the truth 
one way or the other.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:06.750
Remember that.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:09.750
Guru Ma believes that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.166
someone has done black magic 
on the house.  

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.375
She was the first one to see

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:13.250
 what had happened here.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.291
All this happened 
on your watch.

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.375
And you couldn't do a thing.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.791
I am stuck in a case 
that I am working on.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.375
Well, you are the one 
who asked for the trouble. 

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:31.333
Otherwise, we would have had 
a great press conference by now.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.583
The media would be praising us 

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:33.958
and Netflix would be 
making a movie too.

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.125
But you are a complicated man,

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:36.500
"Something else has 
happened here".

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.166
It has happened.

00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.000
 The case was ready.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.708
But no!

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.041
You want to make 
a name for yourself. 

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.541
You want to impress the boss.

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.125
I have had enough!

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.625
How did the murder weapon 
reach Aarav? 

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:46.791
Tell me, how did it reach him?

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.583
You find out. 
It's your job, damn it!

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.250
I don't know what I am searching for.

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.916
Even if I find it,
who really cares about the truth?
