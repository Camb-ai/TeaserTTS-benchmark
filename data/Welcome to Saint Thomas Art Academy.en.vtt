00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
The campus is humongous!

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.889
On this floor is the sculpture classroom.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.810
The stained-glass classes
are opposite the courtyard.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.689
It might as well be a castle.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.066
It's not just the size
that's amazing, though.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:30.280
Here, whether nobility
or common folk, man or woman,

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.490
everyone studies
in the same classroom as equals.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.659
It's quite rare, you know.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.288
How lovely.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.124
The founder's motto was

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.210
"Art is for all."

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.089
"Art is the world's
only universal language."

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.092
Admirable philosophy, isn't it?

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.512
In future generations,
women too should step forward!

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.766
You'll study oil painting, right?

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.395
Yeah! I'm honored to learn here.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.356
I won't let this chance pass me by!

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.358
That's the spirit!

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.361
But the true challenge lies ahead.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.322
Huh?

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:17.702
From sketching to core subjects,
to joint lectures with other schools,

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.662
there's a lot to do.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.958
The critique sessions
are the hardest of all.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.797
I guess I'll be pretty busy.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.174
I suddenly feel nervous.
