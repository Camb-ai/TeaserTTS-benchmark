00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.709
Hey.

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.918
Hey. What are you doing there?

00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:03.753
Cooking up some eggs?

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:04.671
Ahh!

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.798
Damn pepper spray still not working.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.717
You don't need no pepper
spray. Just breathe on them.

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:09.759
You're a dragon.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.597
I'm running for city council.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.558
I thought running for office
would be easier.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:17.350
Oh, Lord.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.935
I gotta save my campaign.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.103
Regina, go fix yourself up.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.521
Excuse you?

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:21.855
Yeah. You're right.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.897
We don't have that kind of time.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.070
We've got four children,
and three of them are screwed up.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.698
Why does everything in this family
have to be high drama?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.784
Oh, my God, what does 
Mom want now?

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:35.952
She's killing me.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.705
I missed a bank payment.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.789
You're taking a real risk.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.126
The only risk I'm taking is looking
you in the eyes.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.085
Medusa.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.504
I don't need to turn you into stone.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.214
You already dumb as a box of rocks.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.595
This isn't a gym right now. 
I'm going to bed.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:54.846
Please come back tomorrow.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.389
We could really use your business.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.809
She done mouthed off 
to the wrong one.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.561
I want a tough mama too.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.562
Whatchu wanna do?

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.606
I know what the hell you wanna do.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.066
I'll do it. Yeah, yeah.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.859
I knew that'd get their ass out of here.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.495
We ain't got champagne problems.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.831
But we ain't got dark 
liquor problems either.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.087
We started this together.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.129
We gonna end this together.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.005
Give me a hug.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:30.340
Oh, we ain't gonna do all that.
