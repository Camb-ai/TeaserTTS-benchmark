00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.339
You know,

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:11.761
every time I come to see you,
you're always crying, Lil' Bu.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.931
Honestly, I'm surprised.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:19.477
I didn't expect someone wrapped up
in worldly desires to be so sentimental.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.273
You disappear from your hospital room
of your own accord,

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.694
and now you're taking a nap
in someone else's room, Buddha?

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.120
There was something
I really wanted to ask you, Lil' Bu.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.581
So I showed up.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.335
What is it?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.675
It's about your ex-boyfriend, Siegfried.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:58.266
He's been locked up in Tartarus
for quite a while, hasn't he?

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:02.854
Is there some kind of connection
between Ragnarok and your ex, Lil' Sieg--

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:03.772
No.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.442
There isn't.

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.528
Oh, come on, playing dumb won't help--

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.905
Sieg…

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.868
is not my ex-boyfriend.
