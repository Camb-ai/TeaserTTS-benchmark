00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.280
-Let's find out what's in the box!
-In the box!

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.640
Oh!

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.440
-Who is that?
-Oh my God!

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.040
-This is the best job ever.
-For real.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.920
Behind me are 13 enormous gold boxes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.840
Each one contains an unbelievable…

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.880
Oh my God!

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.320
…unimaginable…

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.160
-Yeah!
-That is beautiful.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.080
…unforgettable prize.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.560
These are life-changing prizes.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.480
Eight pairs of contestants
will work with and against each other

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.120
across the entire season.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.240
-Whoo!
-It's about to get real.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.280
-He's weak, and I'm strong. That works.
-And that's how we're gonna win.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560
-We are going to take it all home.
-I got bills to pay.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.000
Because in this game,
once you've won a prize,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.760
you've got to hold on to it.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.680
-Oh no.
-"Steal"?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.440
Take our prizes, we're taking you down.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.480
"Prize Fight."

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.320
Whoever wins takes the box.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.720
Whoever loses will be eliminated
from the show.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.760
I feel like I just betrayed a friend.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.280
It's a battle for power and possession.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh God. This is gonna be bad.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.160
I just put a huge target on our backs.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.400
They are here to play.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.640
When it comes to competition,
I believe in sportsmanship,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120
and I believe in boundless domination.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.160
Because in the season finale,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.440
the team with the most prizes
gets to play for the Superbox,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.880
worth over a quarter of a million dollars.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
-Are you ready?
-Yeah!

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.520
Open the box…

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.440
The game is on.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.640
…win the prize…

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.960
-Best gift ever!
-Best gift ever!

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.680
…defend it to the end.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.480
-Oh my God!
-This game is insane.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.360
This is

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.760
What's In The Box?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.520
Oh my God.
