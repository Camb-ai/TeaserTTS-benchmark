00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.504
Do you want me to start
by saying it's the final season

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:04.922
or, like, season ten?

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.720
We've been knocking on doors
for ten seasons.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:13.388
Behind every door is a story.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.140
Oh my God!

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.144
For our final season,
we are in the eye of the storm.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.938
Welcome to Washington, DC.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.981
We're here to give you
a gorgeous makeover.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.442
-Here we go!
-They're so excited.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.860
-You're not, though.
-No.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.154
Every one of us knows somebody

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.865
that needs love,
support, community.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.617
I feel like I've been broken.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.327
I want her to be happy.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.163
Surviving is one thing,
but living is another.

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.541
To strengthen these sisters' bond,

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.960
they need to learn
to accept each other's differences.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.795
She never turned her back on me.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.673
But when you had to fight at home
just to be yourself,

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.384
that was the hardest part
growing up gay.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.635
When you're a teacher in a school,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.971
you feel like the world
is right here in this building.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.015
Despite a lot of the stuff that
terrifies me in the world right now,

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.601
every personal human experience
that I've had

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:03.105
has deepened my faith
that everything's gonna be okay.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.985
You have an option
to live the life that you wanna live.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.447
This is just the start of a whole
new chapter for both of you.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:17.160
I didn't think I needed this,
but I needed this.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.708
Anything can change
if a person experiences real love.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.922
The fight that we started
season one is still going strong,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.134
and even after we're gone,
it will continue on.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.513
Will y'all marry me?

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.724
Yes, we will. We will.
