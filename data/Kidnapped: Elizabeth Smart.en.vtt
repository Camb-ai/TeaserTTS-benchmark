00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.800
Elizabeth Smart was a 14-year-old girl.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.720
Her family said she'd been taken
from her bedroom

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.200
in the middle of the night.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.120
I saw this cut screen,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.600
and the window was wide open.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.520
My wife screamed, "Call 911."

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.400
Elizabeth was living a very normal life

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.280
in a very nice neighborhood.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.080
Our community had mobilized.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.920
Everybody was willing to just drop
what they were doing and search.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.920
We love you. We want you
to come home safely to us.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920
This case captivated the nation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There was a sense of, "Is it the family?"

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.720
"Could he be involved?"

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.120
My wife said,
"Law enforcement don't believe

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800
that you're telling the truth."

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.360
I had nothing to do with this.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.480
There's so little evidence to go on.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.080
But there was a witness to the kidnapping,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400
her nine-year-old sister Mary Katherine.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.960
I knew I'd heard the voice.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.000
I just couldn't remember
where I'd heard it from.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.480
We had the family create a list of
everybody that had been to the Smart home.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.120
One of them was Richard Ricci.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.840
He was a violent felon.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.880
Tell me what you know
about the kidnapping.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.760
I don't.
And now I'm the number one suspect.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.800
Mary Katherine was very likely
the key to finding Elizabeth.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.440
She had been asleep.
She would have been groggy.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.400
Maybe she didn't realize
it had been Ricci.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.600
You were in there, you were doing this,
and she woke up.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.040
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240
One particular night,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.160
for some random reason,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.000
the name popped into my head.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.120
Mary Katherine said,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.320
"I think I know who it is."

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.000
We weren't gonna leave it to the authorities.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.880
She's out there. We could not give up.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.360
I just wanted to tell them,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.080
"I'm still alive."
