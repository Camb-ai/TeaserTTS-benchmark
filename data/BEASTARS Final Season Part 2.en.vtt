00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:02.753
I hate all this pain.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.797
I wish you would eat me
so I wouldn't feel it anymore.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.175
There might be
no guarantee, but...

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.969
I have a reason.
It's simple, though.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:13.931
Because I love you.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.603
We have to accept the fact
that you're a wolf and I'm a rabbit,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.104
and that will never change.

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.190
We're not meant
to be together!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.609
I won't be reckless anymore,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.278
because now
you're by my side.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.697
I can become stronger.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.243
Society and my instinct
won't crush me.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.454
I want to make you happy,
and for that...

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:38.455
I'll be stronger.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.501
I'll wait for you.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.173
I want you two to be happy.

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:52.135
If you give in to fear,
you'll never know the other person.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.179
Since death
is always around the corner,

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.597
I choose to believe in love.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.808
We live in a world

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.935
where miracles
happen all the time, right?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.521
I'll definitely marry you, Haru.

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.192
But before I do,
I will catch Melon.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.739
I desire...

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.784
to devour her immediately.
