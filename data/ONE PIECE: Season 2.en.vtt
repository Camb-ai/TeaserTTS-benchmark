00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.088
First, they were merely a rumor.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.134
A dark whisper.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.225
They are Baroque Works.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.313
They're an organization
of assassins.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.190
Doce Fleur.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.489
It's the absence of hope.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.742
You will never find the One Piece.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.620
My friends.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.414
Together…

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.377
there's nothing we can't take on.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.797
So you're captain
of the Straw Hat Pirates?

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.425
Monkey D. Luffy.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.136
You might think
you're unstoppable.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.974
But your friends
aren't made of rubber.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.021
You gotta be f--

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.032
These guys are unstoppable!

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.999
Now's my turn.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.087
Good luck.
