00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.760
Go on.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.800
Don't be afraid.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.920
I've been expecting you.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.120
I know you're wondering…

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.560
"What next?"

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.760
This year, I see love on your horizon.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200
Hope you know how to dance.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.560
I see a trip

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.240
to a strange new land…

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.000
where your Chariot awaits.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.040
Appa, look.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.960
No, not yet.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.560
See, first, you gotta lose control…

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.640
and let fate show you the way.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.120
The secret'll find you.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.080
-Don't snitch.
-Wait!

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
Huh? No!

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.920
Si.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.000
You cannot outrun your destiny.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120
Bon voyage.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.240
That's… mildly terrifying.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.280
How's this for "mildly"?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.600
Don't look so frightened, my dear.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.840
He ain't that bad.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.840
You'll follow the light of The Sun

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.920
to awaken your inner child.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.120
-Careful!
-Where you going?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.720
Come back soon! Elmo loves you!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.200
Two of Swords.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.920
You'll lose a little Faith,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080
but when Justice lifts the Fog,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120
you'll gain it right back.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.160
This year,
you will question everything.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.600
Everything?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800
Did you bring it?

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.520
You can go now.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.040
Well… you took your time.
