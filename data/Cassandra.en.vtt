00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.040
What we accomplished here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.960
has never been done in
a German production before.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.760
She’s got these robot arms.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.760
It’s like an...

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120
arsenal of household weapons.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.320
So it’s a hybrid form.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240
That means it has a physical presence,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240
but also has digital elements.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.640
For me it was just...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.560
so incredible to get a genre series

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.760
“made in Germany” off the ground.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.360
I play a house.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.880
I never knew I wanted that.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.280
But then I realized that
I always wanted to play a house.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.760
It's a family and love story
that takes a really crazy turn.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.360
There were the robot boys.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.920
It was three dudes who somehow...

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.440
steered Cassandra around

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.040
with a lot of devotion and
the occasional crash.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.520
She’s exactly 1m62cm tall,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.040
the exact same as our actress Lavinia.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.440
I’m Nico Nitsch.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.400
I built the robot’s mechanical parts.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.240
The first thing you hear as a director is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.600
“never shoot with kids or animals,”

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.040
I think now I would add
never shoot with robots,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.840
And... action!

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.920
David!

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.880
because they are also very stubborn
and make a lot of mistakes.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.120
Keep the arms down until the closet.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.040
There are actually three of us steering her,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440
in some scenes there’s even four of us.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.960
Because I drive

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840
while a second puppeteer

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.760
controls the head and the facial expressions.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.080
With the robot, the main question is always,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
“Will it get there without
bumping into anything?”

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.040
And that's not usually the case
with a normal actor,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.440
unless he shows up drunk.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.520
Cut!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.720
I was particularly inspired by
70s household objects.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.280
It's not a horror film monster,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480
but rather, a three dimensional character,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480
which at the right moments,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.800
has to appear threatening and spooky.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.480
You have to let us go immediately.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.160
Or...

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.920
...Or what?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.720
Dessert?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.640
In a very short time, I learned

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.240
a brand new job

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.640
called motion capturing.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.760
Now, look down.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.280
I sat in a room,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.240
we called it “the cubbyhole,”

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.400
it wasn’t the prettiest thing,
but somehow it was comfy.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.720
Rehearsal is up.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080
And... action on rehearsal!

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080
She had to play unbelievably big.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440
Every expression had to be exaggerated

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.960
so the avatar could pick it up.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.040
The whole system is based on
real-time facial tracking.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.640
Look at yourself Cassandra.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040
Whoever you used to be...

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.920
you’re not that anymore.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.960
Cassandra, in this case Lavinia...

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960
is filmed by a camera,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.600
which generates an animated

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.880
image with synchronized sound.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
That’s distributed throughout
the set on all the monitors.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.560
and in the robot’s display.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.160
She also has a teleprompter,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.960
where she can see the point of view

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.160
of her digital self.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.600
Because all the monitors on set,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.040
as well as the robot have
little built-in cameras.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.840
It was clear from the start

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.600
that it had to have a built-in lawn mower.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.040
There were specific situations
where the robot had to

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.560
shake hands, or slice bread,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.840
where we removed the mechanical arm

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.680
and replaced it with a digital one.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.360
There were also things in the script
that the robot could obviously never do.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.920
Like the scene where it mows the lawn.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920
That will never work,
we don’t even need to try that.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.120
That’s why there is also a completely

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.800
digital version of the robot.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.480
She’s not just a robot,
she’s really the entire house.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.840
That mean’s she’s connected to
all the household devices.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.720
Opening doors, turning on the heat...

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600
that’s all Cassandra.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.560
She’s really a great character.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.360
Cassandra runs the household...

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.960
But her worldview is
stuck in the 70s.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.560
Your mom just got home Finn!

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.960
Don’t you want to help her
carry in the groceries?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.040
In Cassandra, people can look forward
to a story where nothing is as it seems.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760
Lots of twists.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.920
Unbelievable tension.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.600
And I’m very excited to invite viewers

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.520
to discover this fairytale-like
story on Netflix.
