00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.545
The prison system,
it's the Wild West in some aspects.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.674
We're locked down 23 hours out of the day.
We feel like animals.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.135
The more you lock a pod down,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.388
the more tension and anxiety will exist.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.684
So if we want real change,
we have to try something bold.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.854
We've got a little experiment.
We're gonna open up the doors.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.649
We're gonna step out and let you guys
control your living environment.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.109
And you can start building

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.279
the skills you'll need
so you don't have to come back to my jail.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.239
I don't believe it's gonna work.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.326
If they think, "I can get away with this,"
what else can they get away with?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.955
Let me out that cage,
you just made me worse.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.332
It's like the streets.
Anything can happen, man.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.879
You can get anything in jail.
There's drugs everywhere.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.672
We gonna get drunk.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:51.801
If there's some tension with another race,
my job is to keep that stuff in line.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.888
We don't like other races
putting hands on our people.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.389
It'll cause a riot.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.310
He's trying to push
his little weight around.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.728
If I was him, I'd be scared.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.105
You wanna be a part of this,
then abide by the rules.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.732
Watch the show and eat some popcorn.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.610
We've had a wave of violence and drugs.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.072
I gotta keep staying sober because
we don't wanna jeopardize the program.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.949
But if we let the inmates
start to accept responsibility…

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.620
-This is my life.
-…they start caring about the community.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.166
If it works, it's a breakthrough.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.002
A lot of these people wanna
better themselves. They wanna change.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.672
If it fails, we could be
making things a lot worse.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.178
It comes down to this moment.
