00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
- Yes!

00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:03.090
Bring back the art of letter writing.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.860
I'm so excited to open these up.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.800
Oh, this person's been to
the fountain. Here we go.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.310
Oh, Agence Grateau paper. Where
did you get this stationery?

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.260
I want some of that. I
don't even have that.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.093
Wow.

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:16.830
"Dear Lily, I'm writing you
a letter I probably should

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.940
have sent a long time ago.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.160
Perhaps I needed to find both the courage

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.350
and the perfect stationery first."

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.183
You nailed it.

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:24.540
"'Emily in Paris' came into my life

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.010
at a very particular moment.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.570
It was right after the lockdown,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.430
and I had just started a new office job

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.610
where I felt lost, out of
place, even invisible at times,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.020
and then came Emily.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.853
Your Emily.

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:36.720
She helped me face my
own doubts professionally

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.670
and personally with more confidence,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.320
and dare I say, more style.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.030
I've watched the show dozens of times.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.950
It became a colorful refuge.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.160
Paris, boldness, friendship,
dreams, and that magical way

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.680
of turning every fall
into a new kind of flight.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.450
Thank you for your
talent, your generosity,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.010
and bringing to life a character

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.110
who helped me far more
than you might imagine.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.970
With all my inspiration, Raph."

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.700
I can't imagine what it would
feel like, I know as Emily,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.420
but actually taking the risk
and moving somewhere foreign

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.300
and taking a job like
you did and succeeding.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240
So I'm very in awe of you,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.700
and I truly appreciate these words

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.770
and the photo from the fountain.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.857
Aw, nice handwriting.

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.790
"Lily, this letter comes
all the way from Brazil.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.560
I know you have been here before,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.780
and I hope you felt the
warmth of our hearts.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.030
You are such a powerful
and honest actress.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.430
You truly deliver in every role you play,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.260
but there's something magical about Emily.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.990
Thank you for giving life to
such a bright, kind, funny,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.040
and fearless character.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.527
She reminded me that being
dreamy, delulu," love that word,

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:38.190
"and yes, different, is not
only okay, it is beautiful.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.050
With love from Brazil, Jean."

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.000
Being delulu is always okay.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.390
These are qualities in Emily
that I really love myself,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.600
and I try to aspire to have
more of myself as Lily.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.727
So it's really kind of you to
say that that comes through.

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:53.100
"Dear Lily Collins,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.560
I started watching 'Emily
in Paris' when I was 10,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.000
and I loved it so, so much,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.490
and I love how the character
you play is so confident.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.710
She even helped me learn
how to be more confident.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.210
I'm so excited for Season 5,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.310
and I wanted to tell you
that you are so gorgeous,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.750
and that your baby is adorable.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.820
I hope you have so much fun
filming 'Emily in Paris.'

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.650
You're amazing. Love, Johanna S."

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.530
Thank you, Johanna. You
should always be confident.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.660
I've looked up to many other women

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.800
who made me feel confident,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.960
so this is a really lovely thing to say.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.830
So thank you.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.327
And yes, my baby's adorable.
Thank you.

00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:23.700
"My name is Vafa,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.340
and I'm writing you all
the way from Azerbaijan

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.710
with a heart full of
admiration and warmth.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.570
I've watched 'Emily in
Paris' not just once,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.090
but again and again, not only
for the fashion and romance,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.790
but for you, the energy, sincerity,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.350
and grace you bring to the screen.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.540
You inspire me to dream
bigger, smile more,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.680
and embrace who I am.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.850
Your kindness, elegance,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.280
and strength shine
through everything you do.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.230
I just wanted to say
thank you for being real,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.400
for making us feel seen,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.050
and for sharing your light with the world.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.540
Sending you love and sunshine, Vafa."

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.310
You should always dream bigger,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.290
and I need to remind
myself of that myself.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.200
So playing Emily certainly
does that for me,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.420
and reading letters like this.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.940
Thank you so much to
everyone who wrote in.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.580
Your kind words and
support mean so much to me.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.740
Truly, I'm very, very touched.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.403
You can watch "Emily in Paris"
Season 5 now on Netflix.
