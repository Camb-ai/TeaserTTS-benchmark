00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.003
Woof, it is rough out there.

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.087
Getting cold?

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:06.089
No, it's Los Angeles.
It’s 78 degrees.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.173
I just mean the world...

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.216
It feels like...

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:10.343
It’s exhausting... expensive?

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:11.886
Exactly.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:16.307
In that case, I've got just

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.659
Actually, I'm wonderful in this.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.497
Season Two is out right now and it's got
even more mystery and more laughs.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.833

Hmm.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.131
Nobody Wants This.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:48.673
Wants what?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.341
No.
Nobody Wants This...

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.259
That's the name of my show.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.428
I know.
I love your show.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:58.516
It's sharp, romantic comedy with sizzling chemistry.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.392
You...

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.394
Thank you.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:05.106
Well, Season Two is also out now,

your friends and family.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.443

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:09.277
Sure.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.363
Give yourself a little gift
for the holiday.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:13.323
You deserve it.
