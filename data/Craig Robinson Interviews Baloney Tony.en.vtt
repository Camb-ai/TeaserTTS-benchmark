If you eat spaghetti for, like,
you know, three days straight,

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:04.462
yeah, you probably going
to turn into spaghetti.

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:07.716
Today I'll be interviewing
my dear friend, Baloney Tony,

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:08.842
so he can share with us

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.220
all his knowledge
and unfiltered guide to life.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:18.518
You know, you got to look at the
the totality of your relationship.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.061
Can you depend on them?

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.479
You know what a good test is?

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.897
Ask them to help you move.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.733
Yeah, that's a real friend right there.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.736
Eat some baloney.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.195
But that doesn't work for everybody.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:33.116
So maybe call somebody you haven't
talked to a while just to say hello.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.868
If I'm feeling sad
and I want to be lifted up,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.703
I would call Elliot.
He’s my buddy.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.539
He’s my best friend.
Forever. Eternal.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.665
You know, who I wouldn't call?

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.499
Joanne!

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.668
Or Stevie.
Whatever she likes me called.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:44.961
I wouldn't call her, though.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.755
No thank you.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.383
I like to exercise.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.386
I don't know if you saw the movie,
but when I first come out in the movie,

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.599
it’s this kind of glamor shot of me
and that's just me exercising.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:04.397
Depends. How much
spaghetti did you eat?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.524
If you eat a little bit of spaghetti,
no, you'll be fine.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:09.110
but if you eat spaghetti for, like,
you know, three days straight,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.237
yeah, you probably going
to turn into spaghetti.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.783
Hugs feel warm on the inside

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.911
because it's a transference of energy.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:19.913
It's a transference of love.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.206
And love is warm.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.750
Like apple pie.
Warm apple that is.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.380
Absolutely. It's kind of my thing.
That and baloney.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.840
I ain't going nowhere.
