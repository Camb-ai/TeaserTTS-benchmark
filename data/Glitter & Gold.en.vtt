00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.751
When I first met Madi,

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:07.590
I just very vividly remember
this, like, bright California girl, like,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.135
coming into this cold rink in Michigan

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:14.556
and just, like, lighting the place up
with her smile and everything about her.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.851
-Oh, okay, it's starting.
-Okay, now it started. Uh-huh. Hello.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.064
When we started skating together,
I remember the impression being strong

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:27.152
and being like, "Huh, I really like
this person. I'm having a lot of fun."

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.199
We had a really solid foundation
of friendship.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.498
After five years skating together,
it got to the point where I was like,

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:45.837
I felt more strongly than just being
a platonic friend or a skating partner.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:51.384
It was honestly
not on my radar, like, at all.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.096
I don't know how to take a bite.
You know how fast I eat ice cream.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.806
Oh, I know how fast you eat ice cream.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.811
You're really risking a lot,
I think, when you make that move.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.064
-Can I try it before it's gone?
-Yeah.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.233
But I felt like there was no other option

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.819
than to really be honest
with how I was feeling.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.823
I didn't, like, really plan anything, and…

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.037
I said "I love you,"
and I think after I opened my mouth,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.540
I was like,
"Oh, shouldn't have done that."

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.751
But then when he told me
and I sat with it,

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:28.421
and I was like,
"Oh, wait. Let me think about how I feel."

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.173
"Actually,

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.093
I think I… I do have feelings for you."

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:37.138
"Oh, yeah, I feel the same way.
That's crazy."

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.390
It was a moment I'll never forget.
