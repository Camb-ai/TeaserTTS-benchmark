00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.168
Min-suk.

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.711
OK, look closely.

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:03.795
I'm going to put it away.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.884
The more money I have,
the stronger I become.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.763
But if I use the power,
the money disappears.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.681
Did you see?

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:15.807
It disappeared.

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:17.142
What am I going to do?

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.730
There is nothing more powerful
than power itself.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.443
It's like oyster sauce
and soy sauce.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.153
Or a fly and a...

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:30.948
fruit fly.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.950
Well, what I'm trying to say

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:35.744
is that I'm screwed.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:40.290
What if you just don't use it?

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.584
The payments
barely cover the bills.

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:46.004
Today, too, the need
for money doesn't end.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.176
Be careful
and continue with your routine.

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:56.932
Don't forget to walk slowly,
take care of the cash, and don't use your strength.
