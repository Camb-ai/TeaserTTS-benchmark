00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:04.087
I did something, very, 
very fun recently.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.757
I got to fly with the Blue Angels
and I met one of the pilots.

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:11.094
This dude looked like he was 
designed in a lab,

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.805
and then AI just shit him out.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:14.431
Okay?

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:16.725
This was one of the 
most beautiful men.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.143
I think about this guy every day.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:19.936
Okay?

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.147
So I walk up to him, I go, 
"Hey, I'm Tom,"

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.356
and he goes, "I'm Seven."

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.776
Whatever you say, daddy.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.240
But we went up for 45 minutes.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.659
We flew vertically, we did barrel rolls.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.122
It was the most thrilling
45 minutes of my entire life.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:45.128
But when I got back, I realized
that we are the only country on Earth

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.757
where when you see a fleet of 
fighter jets approaching,

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.676
you know something cool 
is going to happen.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.929
We send them to the Daytona 500

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.183
to kick shit off

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.561
so that every asshole
there can go, "Look at that."

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.107
But if you're in the Hindu Kush
province of Afghanistan

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.320
and you see seven F-22s,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.156
you're not like,
"Oh yeah, today's the race."
