00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:03.541
A story decides when it has to be told.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:06.625
Modern Studios have
 accepted to do a movie with you,

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:07.625
I have made them accept.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.500
The world is finally going
to see who you really are.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.625
First, this news bit,

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:15.750
and the phone call that came after...

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.750
Everything changed!

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.166
Who was it?

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.416
Your disciple.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.541
The king of acting, T K Mahadevan.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.000
I'll make this movie.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.875
You can watch it from a corner.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.500
The fame, name and wealth
that come with cinema

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.125
have corrupted you.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:37.083
This movie will release
with the climax that I choose.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:39.791
I freed myself from the shackles of work

00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:41.416
to come here and be with you.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.125
I have a doubt.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:47.750
Can't tell which contains more beauty,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.166
that Moon over there

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.250
or this face of yours?

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:56.333
Who says you tear
up only when you are sad?

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.375
I am very happy, and
these are just tears of happiness.

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.125
You act really well.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.458
Whatever happens,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.541
your attention can't waver.

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.000
Promise me that you
will act the way I ask you to.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.166
Swear to me.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.625
A promise.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.125
I fell asleep like some damn fool.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.041
Yes...

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.000
You are a fool.

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.250
But she was only acting.

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:24.791
Ayya!

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:25.791
This is your story.

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.833
I will listen only to you.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:28.541
Action!

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.375
This is no longer a film set.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.916
It’s my police station!

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:34.583
Mohan, your death is in my hands!

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.625
Is he really that good of an actor?

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.875
Are you kidding me?

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:41.000
It does not look like he is kidding.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.375
If this film has to finish today,
this man has to leave!

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:43.875
Now!

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:44.875
Goddamn it!

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.833
Who the hell is Anna?

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:52.708
All I need is 5 minutes to destroy you.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.250
I am not some dust to be blown away.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:58.583
I am a mountain.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.083
Hey, can't you stay calm?

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.666
Are you going to threaten me
using your uncle's name?

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.791
Some truths need to
be hidden in the dark, right?

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:07.791
How dare you!

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:19.250
Kill me! Kill me!

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:24.750
Okay, ready!

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:25.875
Get the camera close.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.166
Yes, it’s ready.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.583
Closer to my face!

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.458
Camera close!
