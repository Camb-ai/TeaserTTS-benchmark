00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.339
It's been a lifelong dream of mine
to climb a skyscraper.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.967
So I'm going to be free-soloing
Taipei 101,

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:10.844
one of the tallest buildings
in the world.

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:14.389
No ropes, no gear,
just me and the building.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.862
I think I've gotten used to fear
over the years.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.949
It's an ever-present part
of climbing.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.869
No matter how much you prepare,
occasionally, things just happen.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.371
If you fall…

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.958
you're gonna die.

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.086
People question soloing
now that he's a dad,

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.171
but this is who Alex is.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:49.466
I have to fully focus on the task
at hand and execute well.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.512
It will be the biggest urban
free-solo climb ever.
