00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.720
Hello?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.200
Sorry to bother you, sir.
We're inquiring into a missing baby.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.440
A baby? A misplaced baby?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.600
What do you mean, Dad?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.200
What are you doing, Trevor?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
It's a long story.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.480
I rang earlier about a baby

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.160
that was left behind
at St. Aldwyn's School.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600
-Let's start with your last name, sir.
-It's Bingley.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.040
So the name's Mr. Bin?
Is that correct?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.720
Well, it's "Bin" and then "gley."

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.320
Got it.
So Bin's your first name, Mr. Glee?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.960
Hello?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.440
Time for plan B.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.920
Oh, hello. It's Trevor Bingley
from Housesitters Deluxe.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.360
We are looking for
a highly responsible individual

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.560
with maturity.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.040
Right, yes.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.320
Sorry.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.240
'Tis the season to be jolly

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.280
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.920
Cheers.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.040
Oh, goodness.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.760
This is an emergency.
We have a missing infant.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.480
Whose baby is this?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.480
Trevor?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.600
Trevor!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.600
-No!
-I'm afraid we have a problem.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.920
How old is he?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.280
Oh, about three months.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.760
He's huge for three months.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.320
Well, you should see his mother.
