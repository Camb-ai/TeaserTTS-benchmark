00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.877
There's one very simple rule
in this world.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.633
Running the 100m faster than
anyone else

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.051
can solve almost anything.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.307
"Almost anything"?
How can you be so sure about that?

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.519
Well, I can. 'Cause it works for me.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.272
So, um…

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.774
Is it too late…

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:30.113
Is it too late for me to
train myself to run faster?

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.742
You make that decision yourself.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.875
That decision… is my own.
