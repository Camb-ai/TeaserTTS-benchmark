00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.962
Sorry to disappoint everyone,
but I'm not a fan of this show.

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:08.466
I grew up in an era

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.388
where you defended
the secrecy of this business.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.100
That's how we earn our living.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.771
Over the next several months,
we just keep raising the stakes

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.399
until we get to SummerSlam.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.193
No days off here.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.696
Seth freakin' Rollins!

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.867
If we can make people believe
that Seth is injured…

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.787
That's where the magic happens.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.041
Lying to my friends and family…

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.168
That guilt has always hurt.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.880
My daughter, she says, "I told Miss Joy
that you had a pretend boo-boo."

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.632
I said, "No, Roux, you can't do that."

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.636
Truth texted me and said, "I got let go."

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.097
We were all confused.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.390
This isn't real.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:03.396
There was a lot that happened
that led us to literally walk out.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.444
I haven't felt fear like that
in a long time.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.907
Along the way,
you're building up these storylines.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.787
The challenge is monumental. Oh!

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.830
When you're in this world,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.500
and you're always wanting to be on top,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.171
you have to feel like
you're always fighting something.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.425
Can you see, like, there's an indent?
This was, like, my seventh broken nose.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.843
Fifth broken nose, maybe?

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.097
I will take any risk

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.849
to become a superstar.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.769
Every day, I work hard for this.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.065
When the crutches dropped…

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:52.112
Are you ready?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.698
…it was a beautiful thing.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.325
It's a great thing to see.
