00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:03.837
There's a feeling you get on the ice.

00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:07.549
It's magic.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.678
I haven't felt that magic
in a long time.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.389
After Freddie,
it was never the same.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.434
Hi.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.437
Wonder how you're doing,

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.357
with Freddie coming back here
to train with Riley.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.235
Partnerships are business decisions,
not romances.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.612
You can skate
with whoever you want.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.283
Apparently, Brayden Elliot's
looking for someone to skate with.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:34.910
-Hey.
-He's a cocky idiot.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.537
He's practically a ticket
to the Olympics

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.829
for whoever he pairs with.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.251
You understand
I'm gonna bring the right partner

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:43.877
to the top of the podium?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.420
Just try it.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.798
See how it feels.

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.057
Freddie's the love of your life.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.062
You dropped me
as your skating partner.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.814
All I can do is say that I am sorry.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.110
We gotta get used to one another,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.406
and we can't do that
unless we trust each other.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.200
I wanna win Worlds,

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:18.328
and I wanna win it with you.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.832
You're lucky to have her.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.834
Is this the part
where you tell me if I hurt her,

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.127
you're gonna come after me?

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.879
We're competitors now.
Given our history, it's probably best

00:01:27.963 --> 00:01:29.881
if we just keep things
professional, you know?

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.174
Is that really what you want?

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:32.926
It's what's best.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:36.680
Let's go win Worlds.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.271
Why did you say
that thing about feeling the magic?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.690
It's not about feeling anything.

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.611
If you wanna win,

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.863
then this is what you have to do.
